# NHS Medical Linear Accelerator Simulation

This project is the simulation for the Exeter Math Certicate NHS Linear Accelerator research in which out team did research on Medical use Linear Accelerators (LinAc) for its structure and measures for dosing

## Geant4

Seen in our report ________, we used Geant4 as our way to simulate the process from the generation of photons (gamma x-rays) to the detection of a Ionisation Chamber (see report). This is due to the extensive physics libraries included in the program.

## How to use

1. Download bash (if windows is used download WSL)
2. Download cmake, and QT 5
3. Download Geant4 packages by following the instruction in their home page
4. Create a build folder and input cmake .. inside the directory in bash
5. Go to src folder and open config.cc, there you can change field size, Source to Surface Distance (SSD), beam energy and depth of the detector
6. Input make
7. Input ./linacv2
8. A GUI should appear, there on top press the green start button or enter: <br>
   /run/beamOn N <br>
   where N is the number of runs wanted to be executed
9. The data obtained after the runs will be logged in data.csv where the field size, SSD, beam energy, depth of detector and absorbed energy
